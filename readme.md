# Simple Coding Test for AIA Nodejs React Native Engineer

### What will you do, in general?

1. Create a simple React Native(RN) App that can read API from backend and display it to user.
2. Create unit testing for your app so it will survive changes.
3. Deploy your application into a simple APK or adhoc IPA (if you can, optionally). 
   Deploying to a public/private distribution (like MS AppCenter) are preferable too.

### What we are expecting?

1. Good code understanding and expertise on using efficient method to solve problems.
2. Good source control usage (using Git!)
3. Practical use of tools available to you.

### What stack should you use?

1. We expect you to use React Native at its fullest to develop the test application.
   Use whatever method and framework you are comfortable with. It's all depend on your preferences!
2. Use any type of unit testing you are comfortable with.
3. Use any type of styling method. You can use Bootstrap component, Material component, or even your own component. 
   If you want, you don't need to use the component too, instead using direct styling. Just do whatever is good for your preferences.

### Details, details.

1. Grab the everchanging public image list from [Flickr public feed](https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne). 
   You can check the documentation from this [API Doc](http://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/).
2. Use a public github repository to put your code. If you don't have one, just make one! Also, make use of good source versioning. 
   Commit often, and commit meaningfully.
3. Bonus point if you can implement tag searching on the image. Just a simple search box with OK button will do!
   Also, put a refresh button if you can to refresh the API pull as Flickr API response is changed constantly.
4. Another bonus point if you implement paging on the app. Also, click on the image instance should lead to its own page which has
   the image details. If you can, put webview to flicker to open the flickr link directly, if any.
5. Optional one : Save the instance to favorite. Implement this only if you already did the others.
6. Expected result is an APK or adhoc IPA. Make sure to support Android 8 and iOS 12/13 and iPad OS 12/13 too.
   Deployment is optional. If you can deploy to public/private distribution, the better.
   If you can't deploy your app, it's okay! Just make sure that you can demo it to us when we do the interview.

### So, what should you do?

## Use your creativity, and be unique. Do what you can do on this test! Don't worry if it's not perfect, we learn along the way!
